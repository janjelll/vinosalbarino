					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area of 
					Saln&eacute;s is a seaside zone of the council of Pontevedra 
					(Galicia, Spain) which is placed between the R&iacute;a de Arosa 
					(the best producer of mussel and the longest ria) and the 
					R&iacute;a of Pontevedra
					<a target="_blank" href="images/salnes-galicia.gif">&lt;click 
					to see the map&gt;</a>. The population of the area is 
					107.618 inhabitants (statistics 2005) and an extent of 
					275,2km2, which gives a density of 391 inhab./km2. It covers 
					the councils of: the Isla de Arosa, Villagarc&iacute;a de Arosa, 
					Villanueva de Arosa, Ribadumia, Cambados, Mea&ntilde;o, Meis, 
					Sangenjo and the Grove. It borders at the North with the 
					council of La Coru&ntilde;a, at the East with the area of Caldas, 
					at the South East with the area of Pontevedra, at the West 
					with the R&iacute;a de Arosa and at the South with the R&iacute;a of 
					Pontevedra.<br>
					<br>
					It is a zone which receives plenty of tourists in summer 
					thanks to its beaches. The most famous ones are the one in 
					the Isla de Arosa and Sangenjo and not so important the one 
					in the Grove, although you must visit the island of La Toja 
					and the beach La Lanzada. It has top mountains which are 
					more than 600m. high in the mount Castrove and the mount 
					Xiabre, the 298m. of Lobeira and the rest of the territory 
					is the one called Valle del Saln&eacute;s. In the Isla de Arosa the 
					highest altitude is 68m., but with a view of the whole ria. 
					The climate in the area is continental, but with summers 
					similar to the Mediterranean zone. In winter the average 
					temperature is about 10C degrees minimum 0C although there 
					are some days with 7C or 8C degrees and in summer 21,5C 
					degrees with maximum 40C degrees. In winter there is not 
					much snow as the last one which covered all the area was in 
					1984. However there was some snow on the highest mounts, 
					like in Xiabre a few years ago and in Castrove, not much 
					time ago.<br>

					<b>COUNCIL OF SANXENXO</b><br>
					<br>
					The council of Sanxenxo has got a lot of beaches with all 
					kind of characteristics. Apart from the Silgar in Sanxenxo 
					and Baltar in the town centre of Portonovo, other ten 
					beaches and also the marina of Sanxenxo got the distinction 
					of
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.blueflag.org/">&lt;Blue 
					Flag&gt;</a> in 2006 due to their cleanliness and quality of 
					their water, which are complements of all the services 
					needed by the swimmer.<br>
					<br>
					The record of blue flags got by Sanxenxo in 2006 are the 
					following:<br>
					Areas Gordas-A Lapa, Baltar, Bascua, Canelas, Caneli&ntilde;as, 
					Foxos, Major, Montalvo, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de A Lanzada, 
					Paxari&ntilde;as, Pragueira, Puerto Deportivo (marina) Juan Carlos 
					I, Silgar.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Beach of A Lanzada</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/lanzada.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Playa de La Lanzada">The 
					beach A Lanzada is one the largest and most beautiful ones 
					in Galicia either for the beauty of its landscape or for the 
					quality of its water. Moreover, for the endowment of its 
					services it allows the practice of sports such as sailing, 
					surf or paragliding. It is part of the councils of Sanxenxo 
					and O Grove, and its name refers to the impetuous bird, 
					whose statue we can see next to the road.<br>
					<br>
					It is surrounded by a wide zone of dunes which separates it 
					from the road which borders the coast. Among these dunes we 
					can enjoy a nice wooden promenade which goes almost along 
					the whole extent of this long beach. The R&iacute;a de Pontevedra 
					here is opened to the Atlantic Ocean, so the waves are 
					wilder than in the rest of the beaches in the council, and 
					the wind is more intense, but in spite of this, it is 
					usually crowded.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Beaches of Major, Pragueira and Bascuas</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/major.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Playa de Major">After 
					visiting the beach A Lanzada and its hermitage, placed 
					between the two little coves Foxos and Area Gorda, we can 
					make a halt at the viewing point of Punta Faxilda, where we 
					can enjoy a splendid panoramic view of the R&iacute;a de Pontevedra. 
					To continue we have in sight the sandy areas of Playa Major, 
					Pragueira and Bascuas, the last one is the only one in the 
					council where naturism is practised.<br>
					<br>
					The surroundings of the beach of Major are rural, where 
					there are only a few buildings dispersed and green areas. It 
					is surrounded, in all its length, by a zone of dunes, and on 
					the right side and on the top it has a little picnic spot 
					with a fantastic view to the R&iacute;a and to the island of Ons. 
					In its surroundings there are several hotels, bars, 
					restaurants, a camping site and a karting track, all of them 
					near the road C-550.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Beaches of Montalbo, Canelas and Baltar</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/baltar.jpg" width="140" height="85" alt="Playa de Baltar - Portonovo" align="left" hspace="10">Following 
					the C-550, from Punta Montalvo to the town centre of 
					Portonovo, we have no less than four beaches with the Blue 
					Flag. The first one is the beach of Montalvo, large sandy 
					area provided with all the facilities and a perfect 
					entertainment area for a quiet country meal. Next, the small 
					beach Paxari&ntilde;as has a camping site and some hotels, being 
					very advisable for its calmness. We pass by Punta Cabicastro, 
					with another excellent viewing point, to arrive at Portonovo. 
					The beaches Canelas and Caneli&ntilde;as, separated by Punta Seame 
					and very crowded. Near them there are a lot of hotels.<br>
					<br>
					Passing by the viewing point of Portonovo and the Monument 
					to the Peixeira, we arrive at the town centre of Portonovo, 
					with the beach of Baltar. We can enjoy a nice and crowded 
					wooden promenade which goes parallel along the whole extent 
					of this long beach, in the wide zone of dunes which 
					separates the beach from the road C-550. Parallel to the 
					road there is another promenade which links the villages of 
					Portonovo and Sanxenxo, both separated by Punta Vica&ntilde;o. 
					After the marina of Sanxenxo, small coves one after the 
					other with characteristic names: Os Barcos, Panadeira, 
					Lavapanos, Carabuxeira.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Beach of Silgar</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/sanxenxo.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Silgar-Puerto">Urban 
					beach placed in the heart of the town of Sanxenxo. With 
					750m. long, it is surrounded by a promenade very lively in 
					summertime and specially beautiful al night due to its 
					lighting and its structure of small bay. On its right you 
					can see the “Corveiro”, name of the rock where it is the 
					famous sculpture of the Madama. The very good conditions of 
					the beach made it achieve the first Blue Flag in the council 
					over 1999. Its orientation facing the West and its warm 
					situation makes it one of the sunniest and warmest beaches 
					in the zone. You can often see sailing boats leaving or 
					arriving at the marina of Sanxenxo.<br>
					<br>
                    <hr>
					<br>
					<b>COUNCIL OF O GROVE</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/toja.jpg" width="140" height="85" alt="La Toja" align="left" hspace="10">The 
					council of O Grove has a great number of beaches of many 
					characteristics; three of them received the Blue Flag in 
					2006: A Lanzada, Area da Cruz, Peralta (Conf&iacute;n) and Rareiros 
					(Pasareiro). In the island of La Toja, the beach is placed 
					at the end of the bridge which links it to the peninsula. 
					From the end of the village to the Punta del Castillo there 
					are the small coves of Rons and Cons Roiboo and two of the 
					best beaches in the council: As Pipas and Mexilloeira. The 
					coast of San Vicente do Mar is an endless series of small 
					and precious coves for the people who prefer tranquillity. 
					On the South part of the council, and near the housing state 
					of Pedras Negras, we find the beaches Area da Cruz and 
					Paxareiras before arriving at the beach A Lanzada.<br>
					<br>
                    <hr>
					<br>
					<b>ILLA DE AROUSA</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/cova-do-fiel.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Playa Cova do Fiel - Isla de Arosa">The 
					island of Arosa is a privileged example of the beauty which 
					characterizes the coasts of the R&iacute;as Baixas. This precious 
					island is situated facing the right side of the R&iacute;a de Arosa, 
					connected to Vilanova with a bridge built in 1985, which is 
					2km. long. Its morphology reminds us number seven, perhaps 
					indicating with that its extent, which is 7km2, where there 
					is a population of almost 5000 inhabitants. It has 36km of 
					coast and 11km of beach.<br>
					<br>
					The winding coast of the island offers the visitor an 
					endless number of marvellous beaches of white sand and 
					transparent water; from the long sandy areas like Camaxe, 
					Camaxi&ntilde;as or Area da Secada, to small beaches in Punta 
					Carreir&oacute;n, surrounded by dunes and pine groves where the 
					swimmer can enjoy peace and Nature, far from noises and 
					crowds. It deserves a special mention for its beauty the 
					small uninhabited island Xiadoiro Areoso. The most 
					interesting spots are: the surroundings of the lighthouse, 
					the small uninhabited island Areoso and the Natural Park of 
					Carreir&oacute;n.<br>
&nbsp;<hr>
					<br>
					<b>VILANOVA DE AROUSA</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/vilanova.jpg" width="140" height="85" alt="Playa de Con da Mina - Vilanova de Arosa" align="left" hspace="10">The 
					council of Vilanova de Arosa has a coast of more than 20km 
					where you can enjoy large beaches and the quietest coves. 
					Its situation in the interior of the R&iacute;a de Arosa makes its 
					water calm and suitable for children. <br>
					<br>
					The first beach we find on our way from Villagarc&iacute;a to 
					Vilanova is the beach As Sinas, linked to the town by a 
					large promenade, where there are the sandy areas of 
					Mosqueiro and Bornal. Inside the town centre of Vilanova, we 
					have the small coves of Fuxi&ntilde;o do Porco and As Bra&ntilde;as. 
					Passing by the town and taking the road of Terr&oacute;n, you can 
					see the beaches Con da Mina, O Terr&oacute;n and O Pasaxe before 
					arriving at the bridge which links Vilanova to the island of 
					Arosa. After passing the bridge we find the lonely coves of 
					Cabalgada, Castelete and As Pati&ntilde;as.<br>
&nbsp;<hr>
					<br>
					<b>VILAGARC&Iacute;A DE AROUSA</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/vilagarcia.jpg" width="140" height="85" alt="Playa A Concha-Compostela" align="right" hspace="10">Villagarc&iacute;a, 
					situated at the bottom of the R&iacute;a de Arosa, can boast of 
					having beaches with calm water and not too cold, as usual in 
					the galician rias. The main sandy area of the council, 
					distinguished year after year with the Blue Flag of the UE, 
					is the one of A Concha-Compostela. It was the flow of the 
					inhabitants of Santiago the reason of its name. The beach is 
					placed between the town centres of Villagarc&iacute;a and Carril. 
					Its length is almost two kilometres. The nearest zone to the 
					town centre of Villagarc&iacute;a, where there is a pine grove, a 
					viewing point and a small garden, is known with the name of 
					A Concha due to the shape of the beach line, while its 
					central and north part, where there is a spa and a garden, 
					is called A Compostela. <br>
					<br>
					The beach A Concha-Compostela is an eminently urban sandy 
					area, where there are usually social and cultural 
					celebrations during the summer. It has two zones dedicated 
					to games for children, one of them in the sandy area itself 
					and the other in the garden of A Compostela. It is equipped 
					with parking in the Rosal&iacute;a de Castro Avenue, which goes 
					parallel to the beach, in front of the old halt of Renfe in 
					Carril. It also has plenty of bars and restaurants in the 
					surroundings.<br>
&nbsp;<hr>
					<br>
					<b>ILLA DE ONS</b><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/ons-melide.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Playa de Melide - Isla de Ons">The 
					island of Ons is situated on the North West of Spain, in the 
					Autonomous Region of Galicia, exactly in the province of 
					Pontevedra and in the centre of the R&iacute;as Bajas, protecting 
					the entrance of the R&iacute;a de Pontevedra.<br>
					<br>
					It has a maximum length of 6km from north to south and a 
					maximum width of 1,5km. Its area is 427,5hectares. Its 
					maximum height is 128metres where we can see the lighthouse. 
					Without the slightest doubt, a heavenly place to go for a 
					walk and to enjoy the quietness of its beaches. <a target="_blank" href="isla-de-ons.htm">
