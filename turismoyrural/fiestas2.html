		<u><b>CELEBRATIONS: COUNCIL OF MEIS</b></u><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/pulpo.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10">The 
		gastronomic field of the municipality begins to be taken care of with a 
		special affection. Tourists and visitors who come to this council 
		achieve a careful cooking answer, as the quality of its meats, 
		appreciated in the whole Galicia, and the delicacy of its country 
		products which are grown here gives the result of a remarkable supply 
		offered in the restaurants, hostels and other hotel industry of the 
		zone. The wines stand out for their quality mainly the albari&ntilde;os and de 
		ca&iacute;&ntilde;os. As far as the first ones, their fame and prestige are guaranteed 
		by the denomination of origin R&iacute;as Baixas, and regarding to the seconds 
		the invitation comes to the open minds, those who know how to appreciate 
		the elaboration of a traditional wine. <br>
		<br>
		The fair and the market of cattle which take place the 2nd and 4th 
		Saturday every month in the place of O Mosteiro, the capital of the 
		Council, show a clear way of rich agricultural economy. At the present 
		time this fair is still one of the most important ones in the province.<br>
		<br>
		The celebrations of the municipality are characterized by their variety 
		and high number. The main ones are concentrated in the surroundings of 
		Easter. During that week there is a representation of the Passion by the 
		inhabitants in Paradela since the century XVIII, which is acquiring a 
		great notoriety in the last years.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/viacrucis.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10">On 
		the Monday of Easter the “Romer&iacute;a das Cabezas” takes place in the 
		monastery of A Armenteira, where thousands of pilgrims go on foot to 
		make the way of peregrination towards the monastery. <br>
		<br>
		The next Sunday it is celebrated in Paradela the festival of San 
		Gregorio, where they bake a “bolo de Pascua” (Easter bread roll), a 
		giant copy of the one godparents give to their godchildren by those 
		dates, which has to be made with so many eggs as years they are. <br>
		<br>
		Already in July, it is celebrated in O Mosteiro the Romer&iacute;a (Procession) 
		of San Bieito – from the 11 to the 14 of July. Within these acts, the 
		popular “Festa dos Callos” (Feast of the Tripe) is carried out the 
		Sunday next to day 11 (San Benito).<br>
		<br>
		On the 15th of August it is celebrated, also in O Mosteiro, the Annual 
		Fair of the Horse and the celebration of the Meat of Colt. The 
		organizers of this fair emphasize that the meat consumed comes from 
		animals grown in the mount, freely, and that as they do not take fodder 
		as they feed themselves on wild flora, they have a healthier and natural 
		meat. <br>

        <u><b>CELEBRATIOS: REGION OF SALN&Eacute;S</b></u><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Among the numerous festivals celebrated in Sanxenxo we must mention the 
		patron saint of the municipal capital (at the end of August), in honour 
		of San Gin&eacute;s, and the one of San Roque, in the middle of the same month, 
		in Portonovo. Among the “romer&iacute;as” (processions) we should mention the 
		one of A Lanzada, the last Saturday of August in the Romanesque 
		hermitage of century XIII, which are a mixture of cult to the Virgin 
		with pagan manifestations of primitive rites that still exist today. 
		According to this tradition women, at midnight and at dawn, take “El 
		ba&ntilde;o de las nueve olas” (the bath from the nine waves), which would cure 
		them of their presumed sterility, in some cases, or of “meigallo” or 
		“mal de ojo” (sorcery) in others. This rite is made to obtain fecundity. 
		Another “romer&iacute;a” is the one called “O luns do Con”, traditional ascent 
		to the Mount Ventureira, where the neighbours spend the day for a 
		country meal.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/albarino.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10">You 
		must visit the Festival of the Albari&ntilde;o in Cambados during the first 
		week of August. Since 1953, the first Sunday of August, it is celebrated 
		the traditional Festival of the Albari&ntilde;o in Cambados, it is the second 
		oldest wine celebration in Galicia and the country, after the one of 
		Sherry, and it has been enjoying for years of the title of National 
		Tourist Interest. It is a popular event, where the wine is the main 
		protagonist with the crowd that, for five days, visits in a tireless way 
		the stands tasting the exquisite wine of this region. This celebration 
		attracts thousands of people every year (more than 150.000 in the last 
		edition). You can say that the appointment in Cambados is of the most 
		important ones of the Galician country. <br>
		<br>
		In Vilagarc&iacute;a de Arousa the Patron Saint of San Roque is remarkable. 
		This festivity is celebrated the week of the 16th of August and last 
		about ten days. It consists on the great week in the feasts of 
		Vilagarc&iacute;a where you can enjoy all kind of performances, from lively 
		music in the street to plays, apart from verbenas (night parties) and 
		concerts of the most famous bands of the moment. These celebrations, 
		including the one of the Water, are recognized as festivals of National 
		Tourist Interest. Although the feasts of San Roque offer us something 
		new every year, we have to emphasize the main acts which are the 
		Procession of the Patron, very crowded, the battle of flowers or floats 
		and the traditional naval action, which is celebrated at midnight and 
		which is a magnificent fireworks, light and sound spectacle.<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="images/almejas.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10">The 
		festival of the Seafood in O Grove is one of the most important 
		gastronomic celebrations in Galicia. It is usually celebrated on the 
		first week of October. The idea of promoting this region through its 
		basic pillars (fishing and tourism), led in 1963 to start a celebration 
		dedicated to the exaltation of the seafood. What began being a modest 
		festivity received a spectacular height at the end of the eighties. 
		Thus, not only the folkloric activities were increased, but also the 
		program was extended in such a way that the celebration became declared 
		of National Tourist Interest. At present, the celebration lasts for nine 
		days when different stands of sale of seafood at a promotional price are 
		opened to the public, as well as the exhibition stall. Music also plays 
		one of the most important roles, to such an extent that there is even a 
		sample of Galician-Portuguese folklore. Likewise, the program leaves a 
		place for the International Symposium of Open Air Sculpture. <br>
		<br>
		The main act of the celebration consists on a varied gastronomic supply 
		of seafood from the “r&iacute;a” (river mouth) such as oysters, mussels, 
		cockles, razor-shells, clams, prawns, scallops, shrimps, fiddler crabs, 
		royal crabs, Norway lobsters, barnacles, apart from the turbot, octopus 
		and rice of seafood, which can be tasted everyday in the fairground at a 
		reasonable price. The fairground is situated in the harbour zone of O 
		Grove, at the side of the r&iacute;a de Arosa.<br>
