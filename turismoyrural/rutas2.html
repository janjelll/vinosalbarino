					<u><b>ROUTES: COUNCIL OF MEIS</b></u><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/petroglifo.jpg" width="140" height="83" align="left" hspace="10">The 
					municipality of Meis is located in one of the inner zones of 
					the Valley of Saln&eacute;s. As the main geographic reference we 
					find the mount Castrove, which crowns the valley with a 
					viewing point that offers an incomparable landscape: the 
					R&iacute;as of Pontevedra, with the Peninsula of the Morrazo, 
					Islands C&iacute;es and Ons and R&iacute;a de Arosa, within the Island of 
					Arosa, the Peninsula of El Grove and La Toja as well as the 
					whole valley of Saln&eacute;s. In this mount there exist two 
					vestiges of the antiquity: of the Neolithic stage, dolmens 
					as the one of Casi&ntilde;a da Moura; whereas of the Age of Bronze 
					there exists a true treasure of the rock art in Outeiro do 
					Cribo (Castrove), represented by petroglifos which date from 
					the year 1000 b.c. and which represent labyrinths, deers, 
					circles, men on horses and the most varied types of 
					geometric games. The fact that many of these territories are 
					unknown or unexplored invites to the most anxious to visit 
					and discover origins and meanings.
					<br>
					<br>
					The following step is the Monastery of Santa Mar&iacute;a of 
					Armenteira (S. XII), glory and jewel Romanesque during 
					centuries of the monks of the Cister, Santa Mar&iacute;a of 
					Armenteira was founded in 1167 by the monk Ero, according to 
					the legend, who remained listening to the singing of a 
					nightingale for two hundred years. This legend will be the 
					one indeed to which the king Alfonso X the Wise dedicates 
					his “c&aacute;ntiga”(ballad) number103. <br>
					<br>
					Despite what you could think Meis is not the shade of the 
					Monastery of Armenteira, on the contrary, it serves to us as 
					a guide to discover the different
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.1romanico.com/004/monumentoa.asp?monu=000676&ruta=087">
					&lt;churches&gt;</a> which fill the other parishes of the 
					municipality. We must begin the visit by San Benito in 
					Mosteiro, head of the capital of the municipality, which 
					originally constituted the old Benedictine monastery founded 
					on this community in the eleventh century.<br>
					In the parish of San Marti&ntilde;o we can find the churches of San 
					Marti&ntilde;o and San Salvador of Meis, both of the s. XII; in 
					Paradela it stands out the church of Santa Mar&iacute;a, where you 
					cannot avoid noticing its Romanesque apse, and in the parish 
					of Santo Tom&eacute; the paintings inside the church already excel 
					in a singular way. Finally we have to mention the churches 
					of San Lorenzo and San Vicente, whose interiors are 
					emphasized by the beauty of their stone altarpieces. <br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/molinos.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="right" hspace="10">The 
					civil architecture has in Meis a great importance. The 
					natural richness and the abundance of constructive materials 
					culminate in the construction of Pazos like Quint&aacute;ns, 
					Pompe&aacute;n, Casal do R&iacute;o, La Moroza or Se&ntilde;or&aacute;ns. Who pleases of 
					magnificent houses, precious gardens, centennial forests, 
					intimate churches… should visit those Pazos, which are 
					witnesses of the social evolution of the Saln&eacute;s.<br>
					<br>
					The popular architecture is also present. Something as 
					pragmatic as a fluvial mill, needed in the primitive 
					agricultural economy appears to us at present like a 
					peculiar construction which attracts in a special way the 
					attention of the tourist. Very well known are the mills of 
					Arcos in Santo Tom&eacute;, but there also exist valuable examples 
					in all the parishes of Meis.

                    <u><b>THE ROUTE OF THE GALICIAN SEAFOOD</b></u><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/marisco2.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10">In 
					these territories of sea and abundance of fish we must 
					emphasize the seafood, attraction both for its inhabitants 
					and foreigners and main part of any of the many gastronomic 
					delights offered in the restaurants of these zones. The most 
					important point of these festivities is the town O Grove 
					which has been celebrating with unusual success the 
					celebration of the Seafood for more than three decades. In 
					this famous seaport we have to point out the geography of 
					its streets, the peculiar statue dedicated to the fishermen 
					and mainly the visit to the famous Island of La Toja 
					recognized by its beneficial thermal waters. It is also 
					fabulous and well known its huge beach of A Lanzada. Other 
					elements of interest of this locality can be found in the 
					old fortified “castro” (fortress) of A Siradella, the 
					wonderful viewing point of Pedra Cabaleira, the necropolis 
					of Adro Vello and the beach O Carreiro.<br>
					<br>
					From O Grove we will take the road which will lead us to the 
					much frequented summery beaches of the localities of 
					Portonovo and Sanxenxo. In the large council of Sanxenxo, 
					apart from the typical “h&oacute;rreos” and “cruceiros” we can 
					emphasize a good set of religious buildings, perhaps the 
					most important are the hermitage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de La 
					Lanzada with origins in the century X and the church of San 
					Esteban de Noalla with Romanesque origins. Others not less 
					outstanding: the church of San Juan de Dorr&oacute;n, with a 
					beautiful baroque altarpiece, the ancient parochial church 
					of <br>
					Adina, the chapel do Santo, the parish of Bord&oacute;ns. <br>
					<br>
					From this point we will go to the town of Combarro. In 
					Combarro, town of agricultural and marine roots, we 
					emphasize its “cruceiros”, signals of the paths or memories 
					of penitents, its typical photography of granite stone 
					houses decorated with rows of balconies and the stroll by 
					its main street. Another element of the Galician singularity 
					which appears in this town everywhere is its fantastic “h&oacute;rreos”, 
					typical barns used to mature, dry and keep the maize. In 
					some places they are called “cabazos” or “cabaceiros” and 
					they have as decorative elements in the vertexes of the 
					ceiling a cross and the cone or pyramid that symbolize 
					fertility. In the neighbourhoods we cannot miss the 
					Monastery of Poio with its magnificent cloister of the 
					Procesiones.<img border="0" src="images/fefinanes.jpg" width="140" height="86" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Pazo de Fefi&ntilde;anes - Cambados"><br>
					<br>
					From Combarro we will take the route to Vilagarc&iacute;a de Arousa. 
					This medieval town is much visited in the summer, among its 
					main monuments we have to point out the convent of Vista 
					Alegre and “pazo” of the Garc&iacute;a de Caama&ntilde;o, with its 
					crenellated towers and chimneys, the church of Santa Baia de 
					Arealonga. Among the civil buildings of interest we will 
					emphasize the pazo of Golpelleira. At less than a kilometre 
					from Vilagarc&iacute;a we find the locality of Carril with its 
					beautiful stroll and the near island of Cortegada, an 
					idyllic forest of laurisilvas where we might rest our fates 
					and taste the famous clams of the neighbouring town. <br>
					<br>
					At the return we can stop in Vilanova de Arousa and know the 
					pazo de Cuadrante, native house of the writer Valle Incl&aacute;n, 
					and the Tower of the Monastery of C&aacute;logo. From there, we 
					will arrive in about 10 kilometres at Cambados. Cambados 
					shows the title of “Very Noble Villa”. That nobility is 
					appreciated in the centennial stones which compose its 
					beautiful squares and pazos. Besides, it is the most well 
					known zone to taste the most recognized wine of these parts: 
					albari&ntilde;o. The first Sunday of August is dedicated to this 
					wine and the town has a great celebration. Of its busy 
					history we could learn of the successive waves of invaders 
					either Celtics or Vikings which became memory and legend and 
					also the defence which has been offered for more than ten 
					centuries by the Tower of San Saturnino in the fishing 
					district of Santo Tom&eacute;. But mainly this rich locality stands 
					out for having in its geography exquisite examples of the 
					most well known popular architecture of Galicia: the pazo. 
					This way we find the most important one of Fefi&ntilde;ans of the 
					century XVI, with its tower and wine cellar, in the gorgeous 
					square of the same name and others not less interesting ones 
					like the one of Baz&aacute;n, nowadays Inn of Tourism, those of 
					Ulloa, Torrado, Montesacro and Salgado.<br>
					Of the religious architecture we should pay attention to the 
					church of San Benito and the church of Santa Mari&ntilde;a. A civil 
					building of interest which we cannot miss is the mill of 
					Seca, for its ingenious structure which takes advantage of 
					the force of the tides.<br><br><br>
                    <hr>
					<br>
					<u><b>ROUTE OF THE WINE </b></u><br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/rutavino.jpg" width="140" height="86" align="left" hspace="10">This 
					route constitutes the best option for the visitors who wish 
					to get deeper into the culture of wine, and more concretely, 
					in the albari&ntilde;o. This is one of the most developed cultural 
					offer in O Saln&eacute;s, the sub sector of the Denomination of 
					Origin R&iacute;as Baixas, which includes the greatest surface of 
					cultivation, production and number of wine cellars, and 
					which is also the cradle of own albari&ntilde;o.<br>
					<br>
					The route of the wine R&iacute;as Baixas, pioneer in Spain for its 
					organization and signaling, allows the tourist to visit 
					several wine cellars of the region of very diverse 
					character: familiar, cooperatives of great size, urban, 
					historical, artisan… In all of them you can taste the wine, 
					as well as their brandies, and know directly by mouth of the 
					producers how the golden and delicate grape is turned into 
					the delicious albari&ntilde;o which cheers palate and heart. The 
					work of the grape growers of O Saln&eacute;s (among them, the ones 
					from Vilagarc&iacute;a) have put the wine albari&ntilde;o at the top of 
					the white wines in the world, making it deserve the 
					innumerable awards in the fairs and most prestigious wine 
					competitions. This reality can be known by means of a route 
					which incluyes about thirty wine cellars of all the 
					municipalities of the sub sector of O Saln&eacute;s.<br>
					<br>
                    <hr>
					<br>
					<u><b>ROUTE OF THE PAZOS</b></u> <br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/pazorial.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="140" height="85" alt="Pazo do Rial - Vilaxo&aacute;n de Arousa">The 
					council of Vilagarc&iacute;a has designed a route which allows to 
					know some of the most important pazos (country palaces) of 
					the region, belonging to the municipalities of Vilagarc&iacute;a, 
					Ribadumia and Cambados.<br>
					<br>
					The route is made once a week, by a bus which leaves at ten 
					in the morning from the Office of Tourism of O Cavadelo,
