					<u><b>THE MONASTERY OF ARMENTEIRA</b></u><br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/arment2.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="85" hspace="10"><br>
					Armenteira is a word derived, very probably, from the Latin 
					armentum, which means cattle, horses or cows. Nowadays, and 
					for ages, it is the name of a stream, a parish and a 
					monastery. The stream flows happy and singing until it ends 
					in the waters of the river Umia. The parish, with about one 
					thousand inhabitants, distributed in fifteen villages, 
					belongs to the council of Meis (Pontevedra) and to the 
					diocese of Santiago. The monastery, ancient and reputable, 
					has given name to the place.<br>
					<br>
					The spot where the monastery is situated is very beautiful 
					and historic. It is called O Salnés. By force of little 
					philological “tricks”, Celso García de la Riega has defended 
					that Salnés means “land of moon adorers”; but no doubt it 
					comes from the word “salinas”. It was the times of “land of 
					salt mines”. Even in the ninth century there exists the 
					evidence guaranteed by documents, there were salt mines in 
					the council of Noalla and in the island of Arousa. Nowadays 
					the zone is very famous for its wines. Otero Pedrayo has 
					written that “the charm of the real Salnés lies on the wavy 
					carpet of vineyards cared like gardens”. And further: “its 
					wines are the red swordy, of a regular strength, and the 
					white albariño, with sparkles, a rebelesian wine, thought to 
					be derived from French plants brought by the monks of the 
					Císter of Armenteira and other monasteries”. <br>
					<br>
					The Salnés belonged time ago to the Terra de Santiago, 
					domain of large dimensions, autonomy and power, controlled 
					by the archbishops and divided into possessions or feuds, 
					claimed by rich men and gentlemen of distinguished lineage 
					and sounded family names. Land, therefore, full of towers 
					and castles, which defended it from the incursions of the 
					Normans, Saracens and all kind of pirates, but too often, 
					hide-outs of nobles thirsty for piling up treasures stolen 
					from travellers and poor countrymen. <br>
					<br>
					It was also land of monks and monasteries. It was passed by 
					Saint Fructuoso and the crowd of his disciples, and later by 
					Saint Rosendo, surrounded by the double prestige of his 
					nobility and sanctity. From very old times the zone was 
					filled with monasteries: San Salvador de Lérez, San Xoán de 
					Poio, Calogo, Sobradelo, Lantaño, San Xulián de Arousa, 
					Sobrán, Nogueira, Armenteira… Almost all of them disappeared 
					because of the centurias and calamities, or they were turned 
					into priories and farms of powerful monasteries, like San 
					Martín Pinario or San Pelayo de Antealtares. Ramón 
					Cabanillas has drawn up with affection the figure of the 
					priors, “ledos e fidalgos”, who administered the monastic 
					properties:<br>

                    <b>Origins of the monastery</b><br>
					<br>
					In Armenteira the majestic Cistercian monastery of the 
					twelfth century is raised, Santa María de Armenteira. The 
					enchantment of the place seizes immediately of the spirit of 
					the visitor. <br>
					Located in a side of the mountain of Castrove, dominating a 
					high and beautiful gorge, gathered, solitaire, it breathes 
					peace and devotion. The authors dissent about the foundation 
					of Armenteira. Some of them attribute it to San Fructuoso, 
					others, to Count Raimundo of Burgundy. Navascués Palacio 
					affirms that abbot Ero “put under a very old monastery the 
					Cistercian discipline”. They are simple suppositions. There 
					is nothing against that we continue considering Father 
					Armenteira the first founder, whom the faithful of the 
					region continue invoking with the name of San Ero.<br>
					<br>
					<img border="0" src="images/arment4.jpg" width="140" height="85" align="left" hspace="10">In 
					the traditional life of he himself it is necessary to make 
					an important distinction. The legend of his secular 
					fascination constitutes a simple adaptation of a literary 
					subject –“the monk and the little bird”- very old and with 
					several variants, as it was demonstrated many years ago by 
					the erudition of Don J.F. Filgueira Valverde. Apart from 
					this there can be historical elements, and probably there 
					are. Of course, Ero –or Hero- was a Galician name well 
					documented at least in the centuries X, XI and XII. In the 
					first half of the twelfth century there lived a noble 
					gentleman with that name together with his wife in his 
					possessions of Armenteira; his palace, “huge for that time”, 
					it still existed, much deteriorated, in time of Father 
					Duarte. As the couple did not have children, they would 
					decide to turn their house and patrimony into one of the 
					several familiar monasteries and therefore, doubles then 
					existing.<br>
					Double convents or monasteries were those where there was a 
					community of monks and another one of nuns. But, in a few 
					years, probable at the request of Alfonso VII, eager on 
					colonizing the country covering it with monasteries of white 
					monks, Ero would decide to affiliate his foundation to the 
					Cister Order. San Bernardo, already near his death, would 
					send four of his monks, as the tradition says. And, as the 
					Order did not accept double monasteries, Eros’s wife and the 
					women who had followed her to become devotes to God, would 
					have to retire to the place that soon was called La Freiría, 
					perhaps in order to affiliate itself also with the 
					Cistercian reform?<br>
					<br>
					In the properly historical field, the documentation 
					available allows us to attend the formation of the 
					territorial patrimony of a rising monastery to a new life. 
					As it is well known, there were no donations for the 
					familiar monasteries; they did not need them; its economic 
					base was the familiar patrimony. Abbot Ero of Armenteira did 
					not start to receive donations after having decided to add 
					his monastery to the service of the Cistercian Order. The 
					three older documents of the conventual file are dated in 
					1151: the first one testifies the donation of an inheritance 
					in Gondes; the second, the one of another inheritance in 
					Vilar and Mauriz, in exchange for a cow and its calf; the 
					third one, dated 5th December, is a solemn royal diploma for 
					which Alfonso VII donates to the monastery the reserve of 
					Barrantes, all the crown of Armenteira and Gondes, with its 
					inheritances and salt mines, as well as Castromao, and he 
					grants the boundary privilege to the monastery, Gondes and 
					Castroman, indicating its limits.<br>
					<br>
					It is very likely, not to say surely, that Armenteira was 
					already in 1151 a monastery of the Cister. Its holder was 
					Santa María, according to the general rule of the 
					Cistercians, and, according to one of the documents 
					mentioned, Ero and his community lived “sub Regula Sancti 
					Benedicti” – under the Rules of San Benito-; what does not 
					mean at all that they were Benedictines of black habit 
					–“black monks”, as they said then-, because the Cistercians 
					also kept the Rule with “cogullas blancas” (white habits). 
					And, what is more decisive, the same formula “sub Regula 
					Sancti Benedicto” reappears in documents dated 1176,1187, 
					and 1198, among others. The first mention of Armenteira as a 
					Cistercian monastery is probably found in a statute of the 
					general chapter of 1190.<br>
